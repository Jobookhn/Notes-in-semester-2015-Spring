#Notes in Semester 2015, Spring
In this semester, I have little to offer you, but the notes of Parallel Progamming and some test papers, memorized with my upmost ability...  
In October, 2015, I tried my best to find out what else to offer, so this repo was enriched a little bit. Now, materials of Mobile Application Development, HCI and Embedded System Design are also on your hand. Just clone and enjoy them:)  
However, this repo is still not so complete. All in this repo are just for your information. I'm in a somewhat bad mood and reluctant to do more.ごめんね。

*This repo, to Hane, who has set my heart to a complicated state.*
